This project is about the impact of Money Ball on spending in the MLB. It was performed primarily because:

  1. I love baseball and especially the data revolution that has hit all sports

  2. To display my ability to clean data effectively and present it in a disgestible way

The files in this project are described here:

  1. dirty_mb_1985-2014.csv: Data source for payroll and performance for MLB teams from 1985 to 2014. Gathered from Kaggle.

  2. dirty_mb_2011-2024.csv: Data source for payroll and performance for MLB teams from 2011 to 2024. Gathered from Kaggle.

  3. cleaning.py: Python code cleaning and preprocessing the data.

  4. clean-mlb-standings-and-payroll: The fully cleaned and preprocessed data produced from the previous two data sets.
