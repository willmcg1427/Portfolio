This porfolio is meant to show William McGuire's previouus expereicne and skills with different data science tools. 

Please only share this portfolio for this specific purpose.

The projects are as follows:

1. AllState_CRISP-DM: This project goes through the whole CRISP-DM process for a large dataset of AllState Customer policies. This dataset is used to predict which coverages customers are most likely to choose based off information like the age of their car and the youngest member in the group. We used suprivised machine learning algorithms such as Random forest, Logistical Regression, and Artificial Neural Network to perform this task.
2. Cybersecurity_RF_API: This project goes over two simple ways at helping prevent phishing attacks. The first one uses a Random Forest model to predict a websites legitimacy based off characteristics of the website. The second is a software tool to alert users when an email has a problematic link in it using VirusTotals API.
3. LeetCode: This file is to display my time and effort put into getting better at SQL.
4. MLB_Salaries_Webscrape_Clean: This project was a way for me to use data that I have great interest in to better my webscraping and cleaning skills.
5. Money_Ball_EDA: This project performs exploratory data analysis on MLB payrolls and performance from 1985 to 2024 to see how Money Ball has impacted spending trends in the MLB. It also shows my abilities with cleaning data and using Tableau to visualize data. The biggest purpose was to tell a story using data, and the paper covers the overarching narrative of Money Ball.
